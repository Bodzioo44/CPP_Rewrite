add method that returns visual representation of the board? array of image paths and nullptrs?

Remove "type" key from the Move json? check if "additional_data" key is empty? DONE
Remove useless "Game_Update" Key from Game updates DONE
change Game::GetBoard() to pass by value, not by reference. (it fucks with the pointers to pieces inside? not sure why? (Image is a NULL Image)) REVERSED?
Move the Promotion Check inside board? leave just the Popup box call.
Change promotion check to a single tile check after each select? no need to iterate

Fix GameWidget methods permissions
